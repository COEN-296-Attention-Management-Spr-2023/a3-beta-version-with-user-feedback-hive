# Our product
Productivity extension with Tamagotchi timer, Todo list, allow/block websites functionalities.

We have developed an extension called Hive Extension with several features to enhance productivity and motivation:  
1. Pomodoro Timer: You can utilize a built-in timer based on the Pomodoro technique, helping you work in focused intervals with regular breaks.  
2. Todo List: Keep track of your tasks and manage your workflow efficiently with a convenient todo list feature.  
3. Virtual Pet: To provide motivation and a visual representation of your progress, we've included a virtual pet feature. When you start the timer, a Pikachu pet accompanies you, and it changes appearance when you stop or reset the timer, reminding you of your current state.  
4. Block List: Our extension allows you to create a block list, enabling you to restrict access to specific websites that may distract you during work or study sessions.  
5. Tab Count and Health Bar: We've implemented a concept where the number of open tabs is associated with a health bar. The purpose is to remind users to limit their tab count to enhance productivity.
